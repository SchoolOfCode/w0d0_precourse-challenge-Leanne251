            <h3>Why Essential Oils?</h3>

           <p>
            As I've decided to give up my job to take on the exciting (but challanging!) adventure to learn to code, I figured money might be a little tight for Christmas this year - so why not make my own gifts!
            I started looking into making my own skincare as shop bought products can have a lot of nasties in them and chemicals you can't even pronounce I thought nice, hand-made natual products could be a great personal gift for my loved ones. 
            So this is what lead me to my research into Essential Oils. To be honest, I previously thought they were just used to make the room smell nice - but as I've read up on them each one has it's own health & wellbeing benefits. Here I'll share a few little secrets I've found out.

        <h3> How Essential Oils Can Be Used In Skincare </h3>
        <p> It is important that essential oils are combined with a carrier oil.
          The potency of essential oil can cause skin irritation if not diluted and a little goes a long way.
          <br>
          To dilute your essential oils to be used with skin care, combine them with a carrier oil such as sweet almond oil, jojoba oil or Coconut Oil. All of which have great skincare benefits themselves, adding moisture and nurishment when applied. You can also add cocoa butter to make a cream & try whipping with your electric whisk for a really luxurious finish!
