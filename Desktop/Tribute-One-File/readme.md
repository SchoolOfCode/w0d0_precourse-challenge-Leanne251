### **What Is It About?**

I've recently been researching homemade gifts and skincare has been one of the options. Therefore, with the knowledge fresh in my head, I thought I'd write about this. 

I've written a little overview of how essential oils can be used along with a receipe that can be recreated at home. 

### **How Did I Get On?**

I started working on the project just before completing the last module of freecodecamp. In hind sight I should have completed it all first! 

 At first I wasn't sure how to create the layout of the website & I was opting to use the position property to try and align and style my elements. 

With further learning I discovered that a good practise way to style your website is to first design your layout using the grid technique & perhaps draw this out on some paper to help. Then style the website with elements inside flex boxes. 

To start this project I was just practising what I had learnt without taking into account the points needed to complete the 'Tribute Page' challange. The uploaded project was a second attempt after bearing these required points in mind.

I feel more practise is needed in the website design and also ensuring when elements are imported, such as images they are space correctly and take up the right proportions inside the grid or flex box area. 

Overall I have enjoyed the challange & am looking forward learning more and being able to dedicate my time to practise without having a full time job!
